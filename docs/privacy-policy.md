# Privacy Policy

**ShopDineGuide**
**Last Updated: January 28, 2025**

## Overview

ShopDineGuide ("the App") is a local dining and shopping guide application developed by JYTech LLC. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **Location Data**: We do not access your device's GPS or location services. City and neighborhood selections are made manually by you within the App.
- **Account Information**: The App does not require user registration or login. There are no user accounts.
- **Analytics or Tracking**: We do not use analytics services, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The App stores the following data locally on your device only:

- **Bookmarks**: When you bookmark a business, this preference is saved locally on your device using the device's local storage. This data is not transmitted to any server.
- **Business Data Cache**: Business listing information is cached locally to improve app performance.

This locally stored data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third party
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the App

## Third-Party Services

The App may display links to external websites (business websites, Google Maps, Yelp, social media pages). These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or transmit personal data, there is no personal information at risk. All user preferences (such as bookmarks) are stored locally on your device.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal information from any users, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
